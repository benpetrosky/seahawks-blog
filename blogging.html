    <h1>SEAHAWKS</h1>
    <h2>Super XLVIII</h2>
      <p>Super Bowl XLVIII was billed as a showdown between the NFL's No. 1 offense against the No. 1 defense. In the end, it didn't turn out to be much of a contest. The Seattle Seahawks defense dominated the Denver Broncos from start to finish, rolling to a 43-8 win to capture the first world title in franchise

    <h2>NFC Championship 2013</h2>
      <p>Seattle's top-ranked defense forced three fourth-quarter turnovers, and Russell Wilson threw a 35-yard touchdown pass on fourth down for the winning points. Seattle will meet Denver (15-3) for the NFL title in two weeks in the New Jersey Meadowlands. It's the first trip to the big game for the Seahawks (15-3) since they lost to Pittsburgh after the 2005 season.
