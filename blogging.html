    <h2>Super XLVIII</h2>
      <p>Super Bowl XLVIII was billed as a showdown between the NFL's No. 1 offense against the No. 1 defense. In the end, it didn't turn out to be much of a contest. The <span class="seahawks">Seattle Seahawks</span> defense dominated the <span class="opp">Denver Broncos</span> from start to finish, rolling to a 43-8 win to capture the first world title in franchise.

    <h2>NFC Championship 2013</h2>
    <div class="sorry-receiver">
      <p><span class="seahawks">Seattle's</span> top-ranked defense forced three fourth-quarter turnovers, and Russell Wilson threw a 35-yard touchdown pass on fourth down for the winning points. <span class="seahawks">Seattle</span> will meet <span class="opp">Denver</span> (15-3) for the NFL title in two weeks in the New Jersey Meadowlands. It's the first trip to the big game for the <span class="seahawks">Seahawks</span> (15-3) since they lost to <span class="opp">Pittsburgh</span> after the 2005 season.
